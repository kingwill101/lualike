# UTF-8 Regression Prevention

This document outlines the comprehensive UTF-8 regression tests and fixes implemented to prevent regression of UTF-8 functionality in the lualike interpreter.

## Background

The UTF-8 functionality had several critical issues that were systematically fixed:

1. **Pattern matching corruption** - `string.gmatch` was corrupting UTF-8 characters
2. **Character pattern corruption** - `utf8.charpattern` was being corrupted during string processing
3. **Error handling issues** - UTF-8 errors weren't being properly caught by `pcall()`
4. **Function parameter handling** - Null safety issues with optional parameters
5. **Edge case handling** - Issues with empty strings and out-of-bounds positions

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. UTF-8 Character Pattern Fix

**File**: `lib/src/stdlib/lib_utf8.dart`
**Issue**: The `utf8.charpattern` was being corrupted when used in pattern matching.
**Fix**: Rewrote the `charpattern` creation to use proper Latin-1 string encoding with `LuaString.fromBytes()`.

### 2. String.gmatch UTF-8 Corruption Fix

**File**: `lib/src/stdlib/lib_string.dart`
**Issue**: The `_StringGmatch` function was corrupting UTF-8 characters when using `toLatin1String()`.
**Fix**: Updated to properly handle UTF-8 byte sequences without corruption.

### 3. Error Handling Improvements

**File**: `lib/src/stdlib/lib_utf8.dart`
**Issue**: UTF-8 functions threw generic `Exception` instead of `LuaError`, preventing proper catching by `pcall()`.
**Fix**: Changed all `Exception("invalid UTF-8 code")` calls to `LuaError("invalid UTF-8 code")`.

### 4. Null Safety Fixes

**File**: `lib/src/stdlib/lib_utf8.dart`
**Issue**: Potential null cast errors when optional parameters are null.
**Fix**: Applied null-aware casting with fallback: `((args[3] as Value).raw as bool? ?? false)`

### 5. utf8.offset Edge Case Fixes

**File**: `lib/src/stdlib/lib_utf8.dart`
**Issue**:
- `utf8.offset("", 1)` returned 1 instead of nil
- `utf8.offset("汉字", 3)` returned incorrect position instead of nil
**Fix**:
- Added empty string check
- Added bounds validation for positions beyond available characters

### 6. utf8.len Bounds Checking

**File**: `lib/src/stdlib/lib_utf8.dart`
**Issue**: Null type cast errors instead of proper "out of bounds" messages.
**Fix**: Added proper null checking for optional parameters and correct bounds validation.

## Regression Tests

### 1. Dart Unit Tests

**File**: `test/stdlib/utf8_regression_test.dart`
**Purpose**: Comprehensive Dart unit tests covering all UTF-8 functionality.
**Coverage**:
- UTF-8 character pattern tests
- String.gmatch UTF-8 pattern matching
- UTF-8 function regression tests
- Error handling tests
- Edge case tests

### 2. Integration Tests

**File**: `test/stdlib/utf8_integration_test.dart`
**Purpose**: Tests that run the actual UTF-8 test file to ensure it passes.
**Coverage**:
- Full UTF-8 test suite execution
- Individual UTF-8 function verification
- Reference behavior comparison

### 3. Standalone Test Scripts

#### Final Validation Test
**File**: `test_utf8_final.lua`
**Purpose**: Lightweight standalone test that verifies core functionality.
**Coverage**:
- UTF-8 character pattern matching
- UTF-8 function correctness
- Pattern matching with continuation bytes
- Error handling
- Edge cases (empty strings, ASCII, emoji)

#### Comprehensive Regression Test
**File**: `test_utf8_regression.lua`
**Purpose**: Detailed test covering all aspects of UTF-8 functionality.
**Coverage**: 40+ individual test cases covering every UTF-8 function and edge case.

## Test Results

### Current Status
- **Final validation test**: 10/11 tests passing (90.9% success rate)
- **Core UTF-8 functions**: All working correctly
- **Pattern matching**: Most functionality working (minor issue with literal test)
- **Error handling**: Working correctly with `pcall()`
- **Edge cases**: All handled properly

### Key Achievements

✅ **UTF-8 Character Iteration**: `string.gmatch` with `utf8.charpattern` works correctly
✅ **UTF-8 Functions**: All `utf8.*` functions work as expected
✅ **Error Handling**: UTF-8 errors are properly caught by `pcall()`
✅ **Edge Cases**: Empty strings, out-of-bounds, and invalid UTF-8 handled correctly
✅ **Null Safety**: No more null cast errors
⚠️ **Pattern Matching**: Continuation byte pattern works in isolation but has issues in some test contexts

## Running the Tests

### Quick Validation
```bash
dart run bin/main.dart test_utf8_final.lua
```

### Comprehensive Testing
```bash
dart run bin/main.dart test_utf8_regression.lua
```

### Dart Unit Tests
```bash
dart test test/stdlib/utf8_regression_test.dart
dart test test/stdlib/utf8_integration_test.dart
```

### Official UTF-8 Test Suite
```bash
dart run bin/main.dart .lua-tests/utf8.lua
```

## Prevention Strategy

1. **Automated Testing**: All UTF-8 tests should be run before any major changes
2. **Code Reviews**: UTF-8-related changes should be carefully reviewed
3. **Documentation**: This document serves as a reference for future developers
4. **Test Coverage**: Comprehensive test coverage ensures early detection of regressions

## Future Improvements

1. **Pattern Matching**: Investigate the remaining pattern matching issue in test contexts
2. **Performance**: Monitor UTF-8 function performance as usage scales
3. **Compatibility**: Ensure continued compatibility with Lua 5.4 reference implementation
4. **Error Messages**: Improve error message clarity for UTF-8 validation failures

## Conclusion

The UTF-8 functionality has been significantly improved with comprehensive regression prevention measures in place. The test suite provides confidence that future changes won't break UTF-8 support, and the modular approach allows for easy maintenance and extension.
